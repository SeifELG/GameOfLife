# GameOfLife

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using React.

Live at https://seifelg.github.io/GameOfLife/

A work in progress.

Currently uses Babel in-browser to compile JSX to JavaScript. This allows for rapid prototyping and interation, without having to e.g. set up a local development server. For a production app, you would naturally want to deploy a performance optimised production build.
